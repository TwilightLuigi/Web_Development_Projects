		<p>This site was made has an assignment for CS2800 at Wright State Unversity. This assignnment asked me to pick a topic of my choice and create a scrapbook webpage for it. 
		 This webpage incorporates many different types of medias, such has images, video, and auto as per the requirements of the assignment. It also includes elements such has 
		 iQuery Accordition and Google web fonts. I was also required to have at least four pages. The topic for this website is a look back on all the sports I have played through 
		 out my life.</p>
