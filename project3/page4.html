			<h3>My Stats</h3>

				normal game play and penatly kicks. The games won, lost, and tied were taken from a total of 240 games. The passes made were an estamated guess, the number maybe
				lower.

					<li>Games Lost Over the Years: 110</li>

			<h3>The Equipment Needed to Play</h3>
			<div>Below is all the required equipment needed to play soccer. By clicking on the equipment, you will be led to a webpage where you can purcahse the equipment.
				I will also give a bref explnation of why each peice of equaptment is required. A soccer ball is required because it is ball used to play the game. The size
        of ball needed, depends on your age. So for example, 3-7 years olds would need a size 3 ball and 13-17 year olds would need a size 5 ball. The cleats are required becuase 
				they are specially designed to protect your foot while playing. They also allow for less frition and better traction on the grass. Lasly, the 
				shin gaurds are needed to protect your shins while playing.

			<h3>A Very Bref History Of Soccer</h3>
			<div>Soccer got it's start over 2,000 years ago in ancient China. However it was the British that formed the game into what we know today. 
			  They are credited with recording the first uniform rules for the sport and over the years more and more rules have been added. Some examples being the penatly
				kick in 1891 and the use of red and yellow card rules in 1970. Some other history to note is that FIFA became a memeber of the International Football Association in 1913.</div>
