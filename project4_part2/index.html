			<h2>About The Game Series/A Bref History of The Series</h2>
			<p>The Legend of Zelda(LoZ) is an action and adventure based video game series that was created by Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuke
			 in 1986. The main plot for the series is that a protaginist named Link must save the Kingdom of Hyrule and it's princess Zelda 
		   from the evil Ganon (the main antagonist), and protect the kingdom's relic, The Triforce. However, sometimes games in the series take place in other kingdoms, 
		   like Termina and have different antagonists, like Vaati The Wind Mage. Another interesting fact about the series is that, it doesn't use the same art style for each game. 
		   Some games in the series use a realistic art style like LoZ: Twilight Princess, while others a have cartoon look to them, like LoZ: The Wind Waker.</p>
			<p>Some other facts about the series and its history is that when the series was in development, it was originally going to be called Adventure. It
			 wasn't until the last minute, that Miyamoto desided to change the name to The Legend of Zelda, this change in name was for some very interesting reasons. 
		   The first reason being that during the time of development Miyamoto was a big fan of F. Scott Fitzgerald and he liked the name of Scott's wife, Zelda, so he
       he desided that would be a good name for the title and the princess in the game. The secound reason for the change was becuase when Miyamoto was little he loved to walk 
       through the forset and go exploring like in the legends of old, therefore Miyamoto desided that the game should have legend in the title. Miyamoto, then by combing 
		   Zelda and legend came up with the games series title that we are all fimilar with "The Legend of Zelda."</p>
			<h2>Games In the Series and Their Impacts On the Series Has A Whole</h2>
			<p>When the first game in the series was released it was an instant hit and it sold over 6.5 million copies, because of this success 
			 The Legend of Zelda series is still very popular today and has over 19 games in the series, with more in production. 
		   However, this not the only game that has made the series popular there are several other Legend of Zelda games that have changed the series,adding to it's popularity. 
		   One of these games was The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, relased in 1998 this was the first game in the series to not be in 2D, it was made in 3D instead. 
			 By the game being in 3D it allowed players to feel more immersed in the game and feel as if they were the ones walking through the forests, mountains, and other 
			 settings in the game. Because players reacted so posititvely to the 3D enivornments all of the games after Ocarina of Time were made in 3D also.</p>
			<p>Anoher game that is resposable for changing the series is The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures, relased in 2004,this was the first game in the series to introduce
       muliplayer compontents in the game series. In this game players could slove puzzles with the aid of a friend, one person would control Link and the other a copy of Link.
       Players loved the ability to play with others so much that other games in the series were made to be muliplayer as well, like The Legend of Zelda: Tirforce Heros. The Last 
       series changing game that was made was The Legend of Zelda: Breath of The Wild (pictured above), realsed in 2017. This game introduced non-linear gameplay into the series, 
		   meaning players could go where they wanted, when they wanted and not have to complete the story of the game to get to certain places in the game. 
		   This type gameplay has been so sucessful that future Zelda games will contuine to use to it.</p>
			<h2>Awards The Game Series Has Won/Other Legend of Zelda Related Media</h2>

       besides gamming. In 1989 a cartoon called The Legend of Zelda aried on TV, the show had one season and only lasted until December of that year, due to negative
       reviews. However a form of media that has been popular is the series of manga books that have been made on the series.</p>
			<p>These books are based on the games and are used to build on their stories. The lastest entry in the manga series is for the Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess.
       However manga, the cartoon, and games are not the only forms of media The Legend of Zelda has, another big area is music. The music used in the games has been so
       critically acclaimed that the music has been published on CDS and there is even an annual concert that is held called The Symphony of The Goddesses(pictured above). This 
       concert cellbrates the music of The Legend Zelda series. In fact fans can even buy instruments from the game and music scores at the concert to play the music for themselves
