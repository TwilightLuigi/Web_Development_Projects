		<h2>Text Columns</h2>
		<p>In simple terms the columns property is a layout property that allows for the usage of placing elements within columns in a webpage in order to allow for a 
		 more responsive design. How this property works is through the usage of two properties called column-width and column-count. Column-width defines the minmum width
     for each column and column count helps to esablish the number of columns that will be used. By using these properties we can obtain a multi-column or single 
     column layout on a webpage. When a mulit-column layout is used the columns will automatically condense themselves down to a single column when the web 
		 broweser is at a narrow width.</p>

		<h2>Flexbox</h2>
		<p>The flexbox property is a layout property that provides an easy and felxible way to style webpages using responsive layout without using float properties.
		 The felxbox property works through the useage of a flex container (the parent element) and the items to be flexed (child elements). The flex container is used to define 
     the properties of the flex box and enables the flex context/layout for all it's children through the use of flexbox properties like flex-wrap and justify-content. 
		 The items to be flexed are just that, they are the items (childern elements) that will be automatically become flexed in the flexbox. When using the Flexbox layout 
		 you create a set of rows or columns that are perfecly layed out with respect to the flex container.</p>
